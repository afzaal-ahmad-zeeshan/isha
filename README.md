## Aimed features

The application is believed to have the following features to aid with the tracking and notification for the parenting. 

- [ ] Track the baby activity.
    - Nappy
    - Feeding
    - Medics (any vitamins, etc.)
- [ ] Track the temperature, feeding, etc.
- [ ] Main page shows the current timeline
    - A tap opens up dialog to create a new track
- [ ] Provide nice intetrface.
- [ ] Set alarms and remind for actions.
- [ ] A chart maybe, for the baby activity?

> Not all the features are useful for everyone, and some are challenging to develop.

The privacy of the data is utmost important. Data persistence is important, backup/restore is important, but it should be important that the data is not recoverable if deleted/wiped from the device. 

## Contributions

P.S. I am a new parent, so the app would only contain features (in app, or in plan) that I am aware of. Highly appreciated to share your comments, feedback, or contribute to the application.
